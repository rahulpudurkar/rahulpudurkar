## About Me  

I am a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** with 5+ years of industry experience, currently completing my **M.S. in Computer Science at Syracuse University (2023‚Äì2025)**.  

I specialize in building **scalable applications, data-driven platforms, and AI/ML-powered solutions** across finance, logistics, and healthcare. My work has delivered measurable business outcomes, such as:  

- Preventing **$6.5M in misclassified exposures** with GenAI pipelines.  
- Reducing **API latencies by 40%+** in production systems.  
- Designing scalable services handling **80K+ daily transactions** with sub-300ms latency.  

I love bridging **backend reliability, cloud/DevOps automation, and modern AI/ML integration** to deliver high-performance, production-ready solutions.
